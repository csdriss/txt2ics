This is a website that I created by prompting to Anthropic Claude 4:
I had the constant necessety to have an ad-free and non-SaaS website that could make by process of making a calendar easier.

My use:
I give the pages that I must study to a random AI by requesting also this file to be a txt calendar one. After that, I copy the generated text and i paste it int this website,
that makes a calendar (.ics) one in just two clicks. 
That's faster than copying and pasting text in Vscode or random websites with Range Rover Evoque popups.
